					<p class="card-text">
						The school year is approaching and distance-learning has become the
						new normal during this crazy and unprecedented time. Many of you may
						feel overwhelmed with the daunting task of homeschooling your
						children and I am here to help! I have experience teaching children
						ages 4-12 and would love to help homeschool or tutor your children.
						<br /> <br />
						After graduating college from the University of Arizona, I moved to
						Houston, Texas where I taught fifth grade. Back in San Diego, I
						pursued a career in early childhood education where I taught Pre-K
						and Kindergarten for 6 years. I wanted to gain more experience with
						older children, so for the past two years I have been substitute
						teaching at inner-city schools.
						<br /> <br />
						I have worked within a wide demographic of children and understand
						how important it is to build a trusting relationship with them. I am
						capable of modifying my instruction towards the needs of your child
						and promise to make this an enriching and fun experience for them.
